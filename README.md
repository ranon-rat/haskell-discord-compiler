# Haskell-discord-compiler

A simple discord compiler that its made in haskell , I made this for fun and I tried to improve my skills in haskell.

I couldn't have done this project without [discord-haskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/discord-haskell)

## How to deploy it

first u need the [haskell dev kit](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/#linux-mac-freebsd) and  install [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) then put the token  in the file `token.txt` .After that you need to run the command
